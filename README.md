## üìù Problem Statement

Time-Consuming Trips and Long Queues
Many customers in South Africa purchase items from stores and must physically travel to collect them. Waiting in line or traveling long distances wastes time and can be costly, especially in areas with unreliable public transport. Studies indicate that long waiting times significantly reduce customer satisfaction (ScienceDirect, 2023
).

Limited Delivery Options for Smaller Orders
Current delivery services often focus on groceries or large shipments, leaving small-scale deliveries underserved. Mobile delivery adoption in South Africa heavily depends on speed, usability, and affordability (Scielo, 2023
).

Uncertainty and Inefficiency
Customers often do not know when their deliveries will arrive, which increases stress. Carrying cash for in-person collection also poses safety risks. Research shows perceived wait times and transparency directly impact the likelihood of repeated service use (Scielo, 2023
).

Driver Vetting and Workflow Management Gaps
Many delivery services lack structured processes for vetting drivers and managing deliveries, leading to unreliable service and low trust.

üí° Solution: QuickFetch

üîç Research & Justification

).
